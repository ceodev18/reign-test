A simple app that loads information from an API REST to show one approach to using some of the best practices in Android Development. Including:  
 * ViewModel
 * LiveData
 * Hilt (for dependency injection)
 * Kotlin Coroutines
 * Retrofit
 * Room
 * Navigation
 
 
* Third party
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code
     and reducing needs for callbacks.
  * [Dagger 2][92] A fast dependency injector.
  * [Retrofit 2][93] A configurable REST client.
  * [OkHttp 3][94] A type-safe HTTP client.
